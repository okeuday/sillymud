World File field description:
=============================

Main structure notes:
---------------------

#<virtual number> is:
  A number for the given room. No two rooms may have the same number.
  The <virtual number> must always increase when browsing down the 
  world file (but increments can be larger than one).

<name>~<NL>:
  This name is the "title" of the room. This title is also used in special
  procedures like:
    "exits"
    "brief mode"

<description>~<NL>:
  This is the general description of the room.

<zone nr> is:
  The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is used
  for resetting zones and monster zone movement. See the zone file.

<room_flags> are:
  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions as:

  DARK           1  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          2  A player 'dies' (no xp lost) when entering.
                    It is a good idea to:
                     *Have these rooms light, because then EXITS will show
                      the room title, for example "In Boiling Water".
                     *Make exits to all rooms from which one can enter the
                      death_room, then the "death cry" will be heard by
                      other members of the group considering following...
  NO_MOB         4  No monsters may walk around in here
  INDOORS        8  This is inside (a house,cave or dungeon for example)
  Peaceful      16  can't attack people, do offensive things here.
  NO_SUM        64  monsters can't be summoned out of these rooms
  NO_MAGIC     128  Not implemented.
  PRIVATE      512  It is impossible to teleport to this room if it
                    already contains two characters.
                    Also the 'teleport' spell will never teleport a
                    player into this room.
  SILENCE     1024  No saying things, or casting spells.

??? means that the flag isn't used yet (and you Shouldn't use it either!)


<sector_type> is:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
  movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

  SECT_INSIDE          0  Uses as if walking indoors
  SECT_CITY            1  Uses as if walking in a city
  SECT_FIELD           2  Uses as if walking in a field
  SECT_FOREST          3  Uses as if walking in a forest
  SECT_HILLS           4  Uses as if walking in hills
  SECT_MOUNTAIN        5  Uses as if climbing in mountains
  SECT_WATER_SWIM      6  Uses as if swimming
  SECT_WATER_NOSWIM    7  Impossible to swim water - requires a boat
		       8  Air
		       9  Water Breathing
                      
                       -1   Implies a Teleport sector. expects additional
parameters after <sector type> : 
<teleport-time> <to_room> <do_look> <Real Sector-type>

<tele. time> = multiple of 10.. 10 is a bit shorter than a combat round.
<to_room>  room number that the teleport takes you to.
<do_look>  if this value is not 0, you do a do_look when entering the new
           room.
<REAL sector type>  The sector type, for movement purposes.


Direction fields:
-----------------

<Exit number> is one of:
  0 = North
  1 = East
  2 = South
  3 = West
  4 = Up
  5 = Down

<general description><NL>~<NL>:
  What a player will see if he types 'look <direction>'

<keyword list>~<NL>:
  used for commands like 'open', 'close', etc. should be 'door' for ordinary
  doors. Example: An exit from a given room leads through a cupboard. The
  keyword list for this exit might look like this:

  "cupboard door~"


<Door flag> [NL]:

  If <Door Flag> is 1, the exit can be locked/unlocked/opened/closed/picked.
  If it is 2, the exit can only be locked/unlocked/opened/closed.
  If it is 0, these commands won't work. (The exit can still be closed at
  reset, however; maybe to be opened by some special routine, like a concealed
  handle).

  The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command in the
  reset-command table (see the zone file). The initial state of a door is
  open.

<Key Number> [NL]:
  The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door (in the direction
  given). If a player carries/holds this object, he can lock/unlock.
  <Key Number> == -1 means no keyhole. If <Door flag> is 0, the value of this
  field is ignored.

<to_room> <NL>:
  The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this number is
  -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might be useful for
  adding an exit-description in a direction which doesn't actually lead
  anywhere.

** Note about doors. You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                     is set between.

Extra descriptions:
-------------------

<blank separated keyword list>~<NL> is:
  A list of the keywords that will allow the extra description to be
  displayed. The keywords must must be seperated by blanks.


<description><NL>~<NL>:
  The description that is show when a player types 'look at <keyword>'
  and keyword matches one of the above.


Example of a room entry is the database:
----------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monster fields description:
===========================

#<virtual number><NL> is:
  The monsters virtual number. Rules are same as for room virtual numbers.

<namelist><!NL>~<NL>
  The space-separated name alias list.

<short description><!NL>~<NL>
  This string will be displayed when the monster take action, for example
  if it is "The Beastly Fido", and fido leaves south the message will be
  "The Beastly Fido leaves south."

<long description><NL>~<NL>
  This description is displayed when the monster is in it's "default"
  position. When not in the default position, a message like:
  "<short description> is sleeping here." could be displayed.

<description><NL>~<NL>
  This will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.

<action flags>[NL]

  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  The bits mean:

  ACT_SPEC         1  This means that there is a special programmed C
                      procedure connected to the monster. When this bit
                      is set the monster "function pointer" must be
                      assigned in the "spec_assign.c" file.

  ACT_SENTINEL     2  When this bit is set the monster will NOT
                      move around in the world.

  ACT_SCAVENGER    4  When this bit is set, monsters will pick up stuff
                      lying on the ground. It will pick up the most
                      expensive items first.

  ACT_ISNPC        8  RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE

  ACT_NICE_THIEF  16  When this bit is set, a monster will not attack
                      a thief which has been caught in the act of 
                      stealing from this monster.

  ACT_AGGRESSIVE  32  When this bit is set, the monster will attack and
                      attempt to kill any player it can get it's claws on.
                      It will not attack players it can't see (for example
                      dark rooms or when player is invisible, unless the
                      monster can detect invisibility)

  ACT_STAY_ZONE   64  When this bit is set, the monster will never move
                      into another zone of the world (this is good for
                      keeping your monsters in your own adventure).

  ACT_WIMPY      128  When this bit is set, the monster will flee when it's
                      getting percentwise low on hitpoints.
                      If the monster is both aggressive and wimpy, then it
                      will only attack players that are NOT awake! (ie. also
                      suffering players).


	here are some more, but they aren't particularly important:

#define ACT_ANNOYING  256  /* MOB is so utterly irritating that other */
                               /* monsters will attack it...              */
#define ACT_IMMORTAL  2048  /* MOB is a natural event, can't be kiled  */
#define ACT_DEADLY    8192  /* MOB has deadly poison                   */



<affection flags>

  This is a bitvector that indicates what the monster is affected by.
  Puff could for example be able to "detect invisible" or maybe
  "sanctuary" (1/2 damage). A lot of these bits are meant for players
  only (in a context with a spell), and should NOT be used when indicated.
  The bits are:

                                  it will block a killing blow once, and
                                  the item is destroyed.

<Alignment Flag>

  This is the monsters alignment, read as:
  +1000 .. +350  Good Alignment
   +349 .. -349  Neutral Alignment
   -350 ..-1000 Evil Alignment

<Detailed/Simple flag/New/multi Attack/not Bashable>
   'D' | 'S' | 'N' | 'A' | 'B'

  'D'  - detailed.. ignore.
  'S'  - what is directly below
  'N'  - slightly different.
  'A'  - like N, but a tiny bit different.
  'L'  - like A, but a tiny bit different.
  'B'  -  exactly like A, but not bashable

(A first)

If you want your monster to have multiple attacks, give the A flag,
and add the number of attacks after the A
for example
0 0 0 S   <- old style

0 0 0 A 3  <- new style monster with 3 attacks per round.

0 0 0 N  <- new style monster.

<Level>
   This is the level of the monster. See "defs.doc" for guidelines when
   setting the level.

<THAC0>
   The monsters THAC0.
   See the file "defs.doc" for an explanation of armour vs. THAC0, and
   guidelines for THAC0.
   THAC0 is an abbrevation for "To Hit Armour Class Zero".

<AC>
   The monsters armour class. See "defs.doc" for guidelines regarding
   armour.

/***********************************************************************/
//  The following is one area of difference between S and N

-=>S style <=-

<Hit Points (format is xdy+z)>
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

   ... ... 3d8+10 ...

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....

---> N Style <----

   The hit points are determined automatically as Level D 8
   all you have to do is give the bonus #.  Example:

   troll with 6 hd + 6 hit points..


   OLD Style :  6d8+6

   New style :  6   (for the 6 bonus hitpoints) (the level d8 is determined
                    automatically)

<Damage (as HP (old style))><NL>
   This is the damage a monster will cause when it is using NO weapons
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exacly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points. 

/****************************************************************************/
  if you want your monster to have a RACE!

before gold, enter a -1  this tells it to expect a RACE at the end of 
the line.

<Gold>
   The amout of gold carried by the monster.

/*****************************  OLD STYLE *********************************/
<Exp> 
   The experience this monster has. Follow guidelines in "defs.doc".

/************************** NEW STYLE *********************************/

<Exp-special bonuses>
   Acquire a 1st edition Dungeon Masters Guide.  Open it to the table
   on assigning exp for monsters.   The base and hit point totals are
   determined internally.  the Special ability bonuses, and Exceptional
   ability bonuses are yours to determine.  Add up the total of specials and
   exceptionals, where 1 exceptional = 2 special bonuses.  take that 
   number (a small number, between 0 and 10 in almost ALL cases.
  (i.e. if yours isn't between 0 and 10, you don't understand how this 
   works) and put it here.  For example:  A creature with 3 special bonuses
   and 1 exceptional bonus would have a '5' here.

<Race> <NL>
   races can be found in Race.h   If you think you need a new race, let
me know, and we can work something out. try to find something that is 
fairly close to your race before we add many more.   

<position>
   This defines the monster's position when loaded into the game.
   A position is one of:

   POSITION_DEAD       0  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_MORTALLYW  1  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_INCAP      2  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_STUNNED    3  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_SLEEPING   4  The monster is sleeping.
   POSITION_RESTING    5  The monster is resting.
   POSITION_SITTING    6  The monster is sitting.
   POSITION_FIGHTING   7  DO NOT USE.
   POSITION_STANDING   8  The monster is standing.


<default position>
   This is the position into which the monster will return after
   a fight. This position also defines when the <long description>
   is displayed - see above.

<sex><NL>
   This is the monsters sex, on of:

   SEX_NEUTRAL   0
   SEX_MALE      1
   SEX_FEMALE    2

   /******************************  NEW STYLE!!!!  *******************/


   if your monsters have any immunities, susceptibilies, or resistances.


   ADD 3 to the sex.  (neutral = 3, male = 4, female = 5)

   add the following 3 numbers

   Resistance Bitmask , Immunity BitMask, Susceptibility Bitmask

   the numbers can be found in Immune.h

   add them together for multiple immunities :  i.e.

   a monster that is immune to cold and heat will have a total of 3 for
   the immunity entry.

/*  L   */

Type L monsters have two string fields at the end, which are the sound
for the room the monster is in, and the sound for the rooms which the
monster is adjacent to.  for example.. a lamia:

#5201
lamia beast~
The lamia~
A strange lamia stands here waiting for her next meal. 
~
This is a creature with the upper torso of a beautiful woman, but the lower
body of a four-legged beast. She licks her lips as she looks at you greedily.
~
100 0 -300 L 2
10 6 3 50 2d4+3
-1 750 5 18
8 8 2
The lamia howls and shrieks at you
~
You hear a shrieking sound from nearby
~


(those last two are the important ones...  You have to have both 
(obviously)).

<value 0> <value 1> <value 2> <value 3> <NL>
   These values are very central. They define the ability of items based on
   the items <Item Type>. These values are defined in "values.doc". Note that
   if you define an item as being anything but a weapon, you shouldn't set
   the 'wield' flag. Many similar obvious rules apply. Example of 4 values:

   If the <Item Type> == ITEM_CONTAINER then the values are interpeted as:

      Value[0]: Maximum weight the container can contain.
      Value[1]: Container flags:

        CLOSEABLE     - 1
        PICKPROOF     - 2
        CLOSED        - 4
        LOCKED        - 8

      Value[2]: The item-number of the object which can open the object.
                -1 means no lockability.
      Value[3]: Internal use for Corpses that must "rot".


<weight>[NL]
   The weight of the item in pounds.

<value>[NL]
   The value of the item if sold - see "defs.doc" for ideas on prices.

<cost/day><NL>
   The cost to store the item in the reception overnight.




Several extra descriptions or none at all may appear. They follow the room
format exactly.

'E'<NL>
<keyword-list>~<NL>
   Exactly as in rooms.

<extra description><NL>~<NL>
   Exactly as in rooms.



Between zero and two "affect's" may be set on an item. The affects could
for example modify a characters strength, height etc. The affect only goes
into affect when the character wear, wield or hold the item. The affect
is removed when the character removes the items.

'A'<NL>
   When items are worn using wear/wield/grab/hold commands, the 'A' will
   allow the items to affect a characters various abilities. Currently
   a maximum of 2 'A' are allowed.

<location>[NL]
   <location> is one of the below numbers, indicating which ability
   will be changed.

(weapon and eat spells)
(the argument is the spell #.. look in spells.h (file) for spell #s.
(eat spells are same as potions (more or less)
weapon spells occur on each sucessful hit.


#define APPLY_WEAPON_SPELL     30
#define APPLY_EAT_SPELL        31


(these apply to skills.  the argument is the bonus, or detriment to 
the skill.)

(this is a combination of 18 and 19.  so you can have +2/+2 AND other things
as well :-)

#define APPLY_HITNDAM          40


<modifier><NL>

   The modifier is added to the APPLY_XXX ability of the character
   when he uses an item, and is subtracted when he stops using it.
   Take great care when using this. This is an example of an item of
   improve strength and armour class. Example:

     A
     1 2
     A
     17 -2

   This adds +2 to the strength, and adds -2 to the AC (thus improving it).
   No more 'A'ffects is allowed at this time.

Abbrevations:
=============

<contents> indicates that the contents MUST be entered.

[contents] indicates that the contents can OPTIONALLY be entered.

<NL> is Newline (return)

! This indicates "NOT" - for example <!NL> means NO newline (ei. it is
  forbidden to use newline here).
