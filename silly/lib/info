  Guide to sillymud:

  Help Intro, for some introductory stuff.

  key notes to the differences between silly and other muds:

  monsters of the same race help each other (HELP RACE)
  equipment and inventory can be damaged by spells and combat
  it is harder to cast spells in combat than not in combat.
  there are 50 mortal levels here..  you have to be 51st level to become
  immortal.
  dragons breath often.  Mages cast spells often.  Warrior mobs will bash and
  kick you, rescue each other, and disarm you.  They might also change weapons,
  to use a better one, or use no weapon at all, whichever does the most 
  damage.
  Things can be immune, resistant or susceptible to attacks, spells, or
  nonmagical weapons, up to +5.  So werewolves, and demons and devils and
  golems are all somewhat harder to kill without magic weapons.

  there are 153 spells, and 25 new skills.  

  Druids must maintain a neutral alignment.   if they do not, they will 
  be stripped of their druidical powers, and become clerics.

  poison is VERY dangerous here..  it does 32 points of damage per tick,
  unless slowed, in which case it does 16.

  fighters, thieves, monks and druids can't read scrolls until they learn
  how to read magic.
